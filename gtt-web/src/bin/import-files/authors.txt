Mishnah or The Mishnah	NULL	Means "Teaching by Repetition" Post-Biblical Collection of Jewish Oral Laws. The Mishna is divided into six* books and 63 treatises, the division being according to the main body of the subject matter, digressions being freely allowed. It was redacted 220 CE by Rabbi Yehudah haNasi when, according to the Talmud, the persecution of the Jews and the passage of time raised the possibility that the details of the oral traditions dating from Pharisaic times (536 BCE – 70 CE) would be forgotten. It is thus named for being both the one written authority (codex) secondary (only) to the Tanakh as a basis for the passing of judgment, a source and a tool for creating laws, and the first of many books to complement the Bible in a certain aspect. 	536 B.C.	70 A.D.	illustration-mishnah[1].jpg	188629
